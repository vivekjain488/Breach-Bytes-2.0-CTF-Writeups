1. First I opened the file given in ghidra since it was an ELF executable
2. Then I looked over the decompiled main function and saw that it is basically it is basically comapring the inputted string by the user to the value in the variable constants

3. Then I found the location of the variable constants and  wrote down its contents in hex and converted it into ascii : }GnIReENigne_E5rEVer_07_0r7NI{ACASISJD

4. And in the super_secure_encode function used in main we could  see that the input is reversed to compare, so we reverse the string and get our flag DJSISACA{IN7r0_70_reVEr5E_engiNEeRInG}
